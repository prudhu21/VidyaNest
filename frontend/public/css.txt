2.	Internal :-we will keep inside the head tag

Psuedo elements:-
------------------
Syn:-Tagelement::hover{
Style
}
We have values like as below
::first-letter
::First-line
::Before
::After
::selection

CSS Float:-
-----------
The float property is used for positioning and formatting content
e.g:- let an img float left to the text in a container
•	Left:-the element floats to the left of its container
•	Right:- the element floats to the right of its container
•	None:-
To display the paragraph to the particular right/left side we use this

CSS Positioning:-
------------------
The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element
There are 5 diff position values
1.	Static:-default value
2.	Relative:-  of we want to keep anything in the middle we want to write top, left, bottom, right 0 value it will come to the center
3.	Fixed:- If we want to keep in one fixed position we will use this, if we move the content this is also moves 
4.	Absolute:-  To keep something on the top
5.	Sticky:-it will stick to the top if we give top, if we move down it will doesn’t change it will stick to the top

Z-Index:-
•	The Z-Index property specifies the stack order of an element
•	Z-Index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, relative, fixed, static, sticky )
•	We mostly use this to get the content2 on another content1 like paragraph on the  image , for this want to give less value for paragraph and more value for the image
OverFlow:-
Visible:-Default, The overflow is not clipped, the content renders outside the element’s box
Hidden:-the overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content is invisible
Scroll:-the overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
Auto:-Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary
Css Display:-
None:- It will not display on the website
Inline:- It will block the content
Block:- The content will goes outside of the content
Inline-block:- it blocks the content in that line only like only inside of the card
Css Grid:-
•	It offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning
Syn:-  display: grid; or display: inline-grid
•	The spaces b/w each column/row are called gaps
•	You can adjust the gap size by using one of the following properties:
1.	Column-gap:-if you want gap only between the columns you can use , we want to specify the value in terms of pixeles
2.	Row-gap:- if you want gap only between the rows you can use , we want to specify the value in terms of pixeles
3.	Gap
Breakpoints:-
How your website will behave across device or viewport sizes
1.	Extra Small Devices :- (Xs) in bootstrap <576px (device size)
2.	Small Devices:- (s) in bootstrap >=576px (device size)
3.	Medium:- (m) in bootstrap  >=768px (device size)
4.	Large :-(l) in bootstrap  >=992px (device size)
5.	Extra Large:-  (xl) in bootstrap  >=1200px (device size)

ShortCuts:-
•	.classname and click on enter to get the div default tag
•	For creating multiple divs we have a short cut div*(n)  n means no of divs you want
•	For commenting we have shortcut ctrl + forward slash
Psudo-class:- stores in var only
•	We will set css theme by using this
:root{
   --background-color:#8bc0f8;
   --text-color:white;
   --box-shadow:0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
    	--border-radius:10px;
--spacing-unit:8px;
}
•	While using pseudo classes and setting theme we will keep – at the starting of the line
•	For using the above pseudo classes we want use them like as below

body{
    font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;
    line-height: 2;
    background-color: var(--background-color);
    color: var(--text-color);
}

Media Queries:-
EX1:-
@media (minwidth:600px){
	//this will be applicable for only extra small and small
}
EX:-2
@media (minwidth:800px){
	//this will be applicable for only extra small and small and medium
}
EX:-3
@media (minwidth:1000px){
	//this will be applicable for only extra small and small and for large
}

@media for importing the things of responsiveness

Structure:-

@media(min-width:value in px){
	.classname{
			prop:val
		}
}
For Example:-
body{
	background-color:black;
}
@media(min-width:600px){
