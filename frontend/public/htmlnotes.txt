    6. Anchor Element

    The HTML "a" element defines a Hyperlink.

    We use Hyperlinks to navigate to other web resources or a specific element within the HTML document. They are also called links.

    6.2. Different ways to use the "Anchor" Element

    6.2.1. Navigate within the same HTML document

    •	The HTML anchor "a" element can also be used to navigate to different sections within the same HTML document.

    •	Add an HTML "id" attribute to the section that you want to navigate to. Provide the hash symbol "#", and the value of the "id" attribute of that section as a value to the link's HTML "href" attribute.

    Note:

    While navigating to a particular section within the same HTML document, the content of that section doesn't start from the starting of a page when

    1. It has less content to fill the Viewport height and there are no sections after it.

    2. The content of that section and the content of the sections after it has less content to fill the Viewport height.
    6.2.2. HTML Image Element as Link

        <a href="https://www.ccbp.in/">
            <img src="https://d1tgh8fmlzexmh.cloudfront.net/ccbp-static-website/learn-technologies-img.png" />
        </a>
    7. Void Elements

    The HTML elements that only have a start tag and do not contain content or end tag are called as Void Elements.

    Syntax:

    <tag />
    For example, the HTML "img" element.

    <img src="https://d1tgh8fmlzexmh.cloudfront.net/ccbp-static-website/tajmahal-img.png"/>
    8. Line Break Element

    The HTML "br" element helps to break the text and continue it in the next line.

    <p>
      Twinkle, twinkle, little star, <br />
      How I wonder what you are!
    </p>
    9. Horizontal Rule Element

    The HTML "hr" element inserts a horizontal line and helps to separate the content.

    <h1 class="heading">
      Twinkle Twinkle Little Star
    </h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Twinkle, twinkle, little star.
    </p>
    <hr />
    10. HTML Lists

    The List is a way to group related pieces of information so that they are easy to read and understand.

    For example, Shopping list, Todo list, etc.

    There are mainly two types of Lists available in HTML.

    • Unordered List
    • Ordered List

    11. Unordered List

    It is a collection of related items that have no special order or sequence.

    For example, List of Hobbies

    • Painting
    • Reading Books
    • Playing the Guitar

    The Unordered List starts with "<ul>" tag. It wraps around all the list items and each list item starts with the "<li>" tag.

    <ul>
      <li>Painting</li>
      <li>Reading Books</li>
    </ul>
    By default, list items in the Unordered List are marked with bullets.


    Values: square, circle, disc, none
    12. Ordered List

    It is a collection of related items that follow some order or have a sequence.

    For example, Web Technologies

    HTML
    CSS
    JavaScript
    The Ordered List starts with "<ol>" tag. It wraps around all the list items and each list item starts with the "<li>" tag.

    <ol>
      <li>Go through the HTML elements and CSS properties</li>
      <li>Complete the Todolist Coding Practice</li>
      <li>Go through the Bootstrap Concepts</li>
    </ol>
    By default, list items in the Ordered List are marked with numbers.

    HTML Attributes:-
    ---------------

    1. HTML "id" Attribute

    The HTML "id" attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the "id" attribute must be unique within the HTML document.

    <div id="section1">Section 1</div>
    Warning:

    1. The CCBP UI kit works only if the value of the HTML `id` attribute of the container section has the prefix as `section`.
    2. So, the id which we specify for any section should always contain its prefix as `section` if you are using CCBP UI Kit.
    2. HTML "onclick" Attribute

    The "onclick" event occurs when the user clicks on an HTML Element.

    <button class="btn btn-primary" onclick="display('section3')">
      Go to Section 3
    </button>
    The value of an HTML "onclick" attribute should be enclosed in double-quotes and the value inside the brackets of "display()" should be enclosed in single quotes.

    3. The "src" Attribute

    The HTML Attribute "src" specifies the path (URL) of the Image.

    <img
      src="https://d1tgh8fmlzexmh.cloudfront.net/ccbp-static-website/tajmahal-img.png"
    />
    4. HTML "href" Attribute

    HTML Elements:-
    --------------
    
    In general, HTML elements can be divided into two categories.

    • Block-level Elements
    • Inline Elements

    1. Block-level Elements

    These elements always start in a new line and take up the full width available. So, an HTML Block-level element occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent element.

    For example, the HTML "h1" element, "p" element, "div" element, etc.

    <h1 class="heading">The seven wonders of the world</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">The Taj Mahal is one of the seven wonders of the world</p>
    2. Inline Elements

    These elements do not start in a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.

    For example, the HTML "button" element, "img" element, "a" element, etc.

    <img
      src="https://d1tgh8fmlzexmh.cloudfront.net/ccbp-static-website/mysore-palace2-img.png"
      class="image"
    />
    <img
      src="https://d1tgh8fmlzexmh.cloudfront.net/ccbp-static-website/varanasi1-img.png"
      class="image"
    />
    <p class="paragraph">
      The <a class="link-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal">Taj Mahal</a>
      is one of the seven wonders of the world.
    </p>
    3. HTML Span Element

    The HTML "span" element is a generic inline container element which is mainly used for styling text in HTML Elements.

    <p class="wcu-card-description">
      Food Coupons & Offers upto
      <span class="offers">50% OFF</span>
      and Exclusive Promo Codes on All Online Food Orders.
    </p>
    .offers {
      color: #323f4b;
      font-style: italic;
      font-weight: 600;
    }
